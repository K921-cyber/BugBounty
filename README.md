# 🔐 Ethical Wi-Fi Demonstration — Intro

![Wi-Fi demo banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wi--Fi-Demo-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## About

Welcome — this repository contains everything you need to run a **safe, legal, and highly visual Wi-Fi security demonstration** aimed at teaching people how wireless networks work, what common weaknesses look like conceptually, and — most importantly — how to detect and defend against real-world attacks.

This project is *not* a how-to for breaking into networks. Instead, it’s a polished educational toolkit for instructors, students, and security practitioners who want to show the flow of Wi-Fi vulnerabilities **responsibly** using only equipment and networks they own.

## What’s inside

- 🎓 **Clear learning objectives** — what the audience will understand by the end.
- 🧪 **Safe lab setup** — step-by-step to create an isolated test network.
- 🔍 **Packet capture walkthroughs** — annotated Wireshark examples from controlled captures.
- 📊 **Detection & logging** — example Zeek/Suricata alerts and dashboard screenshots (simulated).
- 🔐 **Hardening checklist** — actionable mitigations for home and small-office Wi-Fi.
- 🗒️ **Presenter notes & script** — ready to use during live demos.
