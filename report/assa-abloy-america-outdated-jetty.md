## üß© Affected Version & CVEs

- **CVE-2025-1948** ‚Äì HTTP/2 settings misconfiguration allowing memory exhaustion via malicious frames (DoS).  
üîó https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-1948

- **CVE-2024-6763** ‚Äì Improper URI validation potentially enabling SSRF and open redirect.  
üîó https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-6763

- Other risks may include:
- Request smuggling
- Path traversal
- Internal path leakage

---

## üéØ Impact

- Enables attackers to **fingerprint backend technology** and match known exploits.
- Increases the attack surface for **DoS** or **SSRF**.
- Can be chained with other vulnerabilities for more severe exploitation.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations

- Upgrade Jetty to **10.0.26** or preferably **Jetty 11/12** for latest security patches.
- Suppress server version disclosure:
- Disable `Server` header in HTTP responses.
- Remove version info from error pages.
- Implement custom error handling pages to prevent tech stack leakage.
